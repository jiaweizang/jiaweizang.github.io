I'm a physics PhD Student at [Columbia University](https://physics.columbia.edu/content/jiawei-zang){:target="\_blank"} in the field of computational and theoretical quantum physics. My research focuses on using various techniques to solve the quantum many-body problems. Topics include: high performance calculation, machine learning, correlated states and symmetry in twisted moire systems.

<!-- Before I was fully attracted by theoretical many-body physics, I studied experimental physics in my first year of graduate school and in my undergraduate years. I used Muon spin relaxation (muSR) techniques to examine structural and dynamical processes in materials on an atomic scale. -->
